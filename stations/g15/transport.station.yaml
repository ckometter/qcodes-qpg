# YAML Station configuration file for G15
#
# This file gets snapshotted and can be read back from the JSON
# snapshot for every experiment run.
#
# The file starts with a list of loadable instruments instances,
# i.e. there can be two entries for two instruments of the same
# type if you want to specify two different use cases
# e.g. "dmm1-readout" and "dmm1-calibration".
#
instruments:
  # Each instrument is specified by its name.
  # This name is what is looked up by the `load_instrument`
  # method of `Station`.
